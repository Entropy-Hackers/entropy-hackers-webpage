Welcome to **Entropy Hackers – Verein zur Erforschung dissipativer Strukturen**. Based in Graz, Austria, we are an international organization dedicated to exploring and fostering innovative approaches to dissipative structures. Our work transcends national boundaries, operating both in physical spaces and virtual realms to advance our mission.

The Entropy Hackers are driven by a singular goal: to develop innovative approaches to the study and design of dissipative structures. We explore theoretical and practical methods to reduce entropy in complex systems across diverse domains.

In our **OpenLab**, which operates both in physical spaces and virtually, we design, test, and refine experiments, concepts, and interventions. Our focus is on analyzing, organizing, and enhancing complex, self-organizing processes. Through our efforts, we aim to uncover new perspectives and strategies for better understanding, stabilizing, and influencing dynamic systems.

Our mission is not confined to Earth alone. Should intelligent, communicable beings beyond our planet exist, we welcome the possibility of collaboration or exchange with them to expand our horizons. We are a nonprofit organization committed to maintaining independence from political, religious, or scientific ideologies. Our open and unbiased approach drives us to seek groundbreaking strategies for the evolution of adaptable systems.
